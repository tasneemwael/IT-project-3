    <h1 class="styled">Maintaining good health</h1>
    <p class="styled">Regular exercise is crucial for overall well-being. Exercising regularly, every day if possible,
        is the single most important thing you can do for your health. In the short term, exercise helps to control
        appetite,
        boost mood, and improve sleep.
    <p class="styled">In the long term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia,
        depression, and many cancers.
        Engaging in physical activity not only strengthens muscles and improves cardiovascular health but also boosts
        mood and
        reduces stress.
    </p>
    <p class="styled">Whether it's brisk walking, cycling, swimming, or yoga, finding an activity that you enjoy can
        make sticking
        to a fitness routine easier. Additionally, incorporating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean
        proteins,
        and whole grains complements exercise efforts, providing the body with essential nutrients for optimal
        performance and recovery.
        <br>Prioritizing both regular exercise and healthy eating habits lays the foundation for a healthier, happier
        life.

                No matter what your current weight is, being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,
                the "good" cholesterol, and it decreases unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood
                flowing smoothly,
                which lowers your risk of heart and blood vessel, called cardiovascular, diseases.
                Regular exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and concerns, including: (Press on the
